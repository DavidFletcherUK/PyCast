Tasks that I have completed:

1) Part 1 (Worked as a group)
2)* Part 2 (Completed my own version)
3)* Part 3 (Complete my own version)
4) Part 4 (implemented all but error checking and the regex for integer constant)

* Part 3 & 4, me and Andy worked on individually without realizing the other was other 
on it so I have included my implementations just for my own sake. Both work fine so we
will be using Andy's version for marking.
